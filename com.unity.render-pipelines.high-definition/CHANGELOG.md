# Changelog

## [2018.2 undecided]
- Fix issue with LOD transition and instancing
- Fix discrepency between object motion vector and camera motion vector

### Improvements
- Add stripper of shader variant when building a player. Save shader compile time.
- Disable per-object culling that was executed in C++ in HD whereas it was not used (Optimization)
- Enable texture streaming debugging (was not working before 2018.2)
- Added Screen Space Reflection with Proxy Projection Model
- Support correctly scene selection for alpha tested object
- Add per light shadow mask mode control (i.e shadow mask distance and shadow mask). It use the option NonLightmappedOnly
- Add geometric filtering to Lit shader (allow to reduce specular aliasing)

### Changed, Removals and deprecations
- Removed GlobalLightLoopSettings.maxPlanarReflectionProbes and instead use value of GlobalLightLoopSettings.planarReflectionProbeCacheSize
- Changed SupportForwardOnly to SupportOnlyForward in render pipeline settings

## [2018.1 undecided]

### Improvements
- Configure the VolumetricLightingSystem code path to be on by default
- Trigger a build exception when trying to build an unsupported platform
- Introduce the VolumetricLightingController component, which can (and should) be placed on the camera, and allows one to control the near and the far plane of the V-Buffer (volumetric "froxel" buffer) along with the depth distribution (from logarithmic to linear)
- Add 3D texture support for DensityVolumes
- Add a better mapping of roughness to mipmap for planar reflection
- The VolumetricLightingSystem now uses RTHandles, which allows to save memory by sharing buffers between different cameras (history buffers are not shared), and reduce reallocation frequency by reallocating buffers only if the rendering resolution increases (and suballocating within existing buffers if the rendering resolution decreases)
- Add a Volumetric Dimmer slider to lights to control the intensity of the scattered volumetric lighting
- Add UV tiling and offset support for decals.

### Changed, Removals and deprecations
- Remove Resource folder of PreIntegratedFGD and add the resource to RenderPipeline Asset
- Default number of planar reflection change from 4 to 2
- Rename _MainDepthTexture to _CameraDepthTexture
- The VolumetricLightingController has been moved to the Interpolation Volume framework and now functions similarly to the VolumetricFog settings
- Update of UI of cookie, CubeCookie, Reflection probe and planar reflection probe to combo box
- Allow enabling/disabling shadows for area lights when they are set to baked.
- Hide applyRangeAttenuation and FadeDistance for directional shadow as they are not used

### Bug fixes
- Fix ConvertPhysicalLightIntensityToLightIntensity() function used when creating light from script to match HDLightEditor behavior
- Fix numerical issues with the default value of mean free path of volumetric fog 
- Fix the bug preventing decals from coexisting with density volumes
- Fix issue with alpha tested geometry using planar/triplanar mapping not render correctly or flickering (due to being wrongly alpha tested in depth prepass)
- Fix meta pass with triplanar (was not handling correctly the normal)
- Fix preview when a planar reflection is present
- Fix Camera preview, it is now a Preview cameraType (was a SceneView)
- Fix handling unknown GPUShadowTypes in the shadow manager.
- Fix area light shapes sent as point lights to the baking backends when they are set to baked.
- Fix unnecessary division by PI for baked area lights.
- Fix line lights sent to the lightmappers. The backends don't support this light type.
- Fix issue with shadow mask framesettings not correctly taken into account when shadow mask is enabled for lighting.
- Fix directional light and shadow mask transition, they are now matching making smooth transition
- Fix banding issues caused by high intensity volumetric lighting
- Fix the debug window being emptied on SRP asset reload
- Fix issue with debug mode not correctly clearing the GBuffer in editor after a resize
- Fix issue with ResetMaterialKeyword not resetting correctly ToggleOff/Roggle Keyword
- Fix issue with motion vector not render correctly if there is no depth prepass in deferred

## [2018.1.0f2]

### Improvements
- Screen Space Refraction projection model (Proxy raycasting, HiZ raymarching)
- Screen Space Refraction settings as volume component
- Added buffered frame history per camera
- Port Global Density Volumes to the Interpolation Volume System.
- Optimize ImportanceSampleLambert() to not require the tangent frame.
- Generalize SampleVBuffer() to handle different sampling and reconstruction methods.
- Improve the quality of volumetric lighting reprojection.
- Optimize Morton Order code in the Subsurface Scattering pass.
- Planar Reflection Probe support roughness (gaussian convolution of captured probe)
- Use an atlas instead of a texture array for cluster transparent decals
- Add a debug view to visualize the decal atlas
- Only store decal textures to atlas if decal is visible, debounce out of memory decal atlas warning.
- Add manipulator gizmo on decal to improve authoring workflow
- Add a minimal StackLit material (work in progress, this version can be used as template to add new material)

### Changed, Removals and deprecations
- EnableShadowMask in FrameSettings (But shadowMaskSupport still disable by default)
- Forced Planar Probe update modes to (Realtime, Every Update, Mirror Camera)
- Removed Planar Probe mirror plane position and normal fields in inspector, always display mirror plane and normal gizmos
- Screen Space Refraction proxy model uses the proxy of the first environment light (Reflection probe/Planar probe) or the sky
- Moved RTHandle static methods to RTHandles
- Renamed RTHandle to RTHandleSystem.RTHandle
- Move code for PreIntegratedFDG (Lit.shader) into its dedicated folder to be share with other material
- Move code for LTCArea (Lit.shader) into its dedicated folder to be share with other material
 
### Bug fixes
- Fix fog flags in scene view is now taken into account
- Fix sky in preview windows that were disappearing after a load of a new level
- Fix numerical issues in IntersectRayAABB().
- Fix alpha blending of volumetric lighting with transparent objects.
- Fix the near plane of the V-Buffer causing out-of-bounds look-ups in the clustered data structure.
- Depth and color pyramid are properly computed and sampled when the camera renders inside a viewport of a RTHandle.
- Fix decal atlas debug view to work correctly when shadow atlas view is also enabled
